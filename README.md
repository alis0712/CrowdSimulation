# Crowd Simulation
The goal of this project was to build a simple active shooter module at a university campus setting. Photon network framework was implemented to this project to enable  multiplayer features. A behavior AI was added to the pedestrians in this system which simulates psuedo real-world behavior. 

Below are three short videos which demonstrates the pedestrian behavior during two scenarios which are: <br />
Identify, enagage and neutralize the shooter <br />
Evacuate the scene <br />
